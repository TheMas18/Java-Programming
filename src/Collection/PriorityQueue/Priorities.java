/*Question
 * In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type which is like
 * a regular queue, but where additionally each element has a "priority"
 * associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is
 * served before an element with low priority. - Wikipedia
 * 
 * In this problem we will test your knowledge on Java Priority Queue.
 * 
 * There are a number of students in a school who wait to be served. Two types
 * of events, ENTER and SERVED, can take place which are described below.
 * 
 * ENTER: A student with some priority enters the queue to be served. SERVED:
 * The student with the highest priority is served (removed) from the queue. A
 * unique id is assigned to each student entering the queue. The queue serves
 * the students based on the following criteria (priority criteria):
 * 
 * The student having the highest Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is
 * served first. Any students having the same CGPA will be served by name in
 * ascending case-sensitive alphabetical order. Any students having the same
 * CGPA and name will be served in ascending order of the id. Create the
 * following two classes:
 * 
 * The Student class should implement: The constructor Student(int id, String
 * name, double cgpa). The method int getID() to return the id of the student.
 * The method String getName() to return the name of the student. The method
 * double getCGPA() to return the CGPA of the student. The Priorities class
 * should implement the method List<Student> getStudents(List<String> events) to
 * process all the given events and return all the students yet to be served in
 * the priority order. Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer, , describing the total number of events.
 * Each of the subsequent lines will be of the following two forms:
 * 
 * ENTER name CGPA id: The student to be inserted into the priority queue.
 * SERVED: The highest priority student in the queue was served. The locked stub
 * code in the editor reads the input and tests the correctness of the Student
 * and Priorities classes implementation.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * The locked stub code prints the names of the students yet to be served in the
 * priority order. If there are no such student, then the code prints EMPTY.
 * 
 * Sample Input 0
 * 
 * 12 ENTER John 3.75 50 ENTER Mark 3.8 24 ENTER Shafaet 3.7 35 SERVED SERVED
 * ENTER Samiha 3.85 36 SERVED ENTER Ashley 3.9 42 ENTER Maria 3.6 46 ENTER Anik
 * 3.95 49 ENTER Dan 3.95 50 SERVED Sample Output 0
 * 
 * Dan Ashley Shafaet Maria Explanation 0
 * 
 * In this case, the number of events is 12. Let the name of the queue be Q.
 * 
 * John is added to Q. So, it contains (John, 3.75, 50). Mark is added to Q. So,
 * it contains (John, 3.75, 50) and (Mark, 3.8, 24). Shafaet is added to Q. So,
 * it contains (John, 3.75, 50), (Mark, 3.8, 24), and (Shafaet, 3.7, 35). Mark
 * is served as he has the highest CGPA. So, Q contains (John, 3.75, 50) and
 * (Shafaet, 3.7, 35). John is served next as he has the highest CGPA. So, Q
 * contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35). Samiha is added to Q. So, it contains (Shafaet,
 * 3.7, 35) and (Samiha, 3.85, 36). Samiha is served as she has the highest
 * CGPA. So, Q contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35). Now, four more students are added to
 * Q. So, it contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35), (Ashley, 3.9, 42), (Maria, 3.6, 46),
 * (Anik, 3.95, 49), and (Dan, 3.95, 50). Anik is served because though both
 * Anil and Dan have the highest CGPA but Anik comes first when sorted in
 * alphabetic order. So, Q contains (Dan, 3.95, 50), (Ashley, 3.9, 42),
 * (Shafaet, 3.7, 35), and (Maria, 3.6, 46). As all events are completed, the
 * name of each of the remaining students is printed on a new line.
